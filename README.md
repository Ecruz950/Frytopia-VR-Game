# Frytopia – A Fast-Paced VR Fry Assembly Game

**Frytopia** is a fast-paced, physics-based virtual reality game where players take on the role of a fry cook in a chaotic fast-food kitchen. The objective is simple: grab fries, pack them accurately with the correct toppings, and deliver them to customers before time runs out — all while facing escalating challenges like fryer malfunctions, impatient customers, and messy workspaces.


## Gameplay Overview

- Grab, Pack, Deliver: Use VR hand controls to assemble and deliver fry orders.
- Toppings Chaos: Handle diverse orders with toppings like ketchup, cheese, jalapeños, and more.
- Time Pressure: Beat the clock to serve customers accurately and quickly.
- Dynamic Difficulty: Face slippery objects, complaining customers, and random kitchen disasters.
- Scoring System: Points based on speed and accuracy of order fulfillment.


## Technologies Used

- Unity 3D – Core game engine
- OpenXR Plugin – Ensures cross-platform VR compatibility
- XR Interaction Toolkit – Handles hand-tracking, grabbing, and object interaction
- Unity PhysX – Realistic physics for fries and object collisions
- Unity Asset Store – Free assets used for fry cups, fries, and store layout
- Unity Cloud Build & PlasticSCM – Used earlier for collaboration and version control
